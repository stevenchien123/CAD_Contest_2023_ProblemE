## For compression:
1. Put the input file into "Compress" directory.
2. cd to Compress directory.
3. run the executable file, ex: ./cada0042_final inputfilename.bin
   if permission denied, run the command: chmod u+x cada0042_final
   then run the executable file again.
4. While execution finished, there are some output binary file in "inputfilename" directory.

## For decompression:
1. cd to Decompress directory.
2. run the executable file, ex: ./cada0042_final inputfilename.bin
   if permission denied, run the command: chmod u+x cada0042_final
   then run the executable file again.
3. While execution finished, there is a output binary file "decompressed.bin".

## Result
1. Test case 1 (983040 bits) :
   
   Compression / Decompression time : 12.274 / 17.194 (s)

   Compression ratio (before/after) : 31.6 %

2. Test case 2 (851968 bits) :
   
   Compression / Decompression time : 4.333 / 14.282 (s)
   
   Compression ratio (before/after) : 31.6 %
   
3. Test case 3 (524288 bits) :
   
   Compression / Decompression time : 6.253 / 8.816 (s)
   
   Compression ratio (before/after) : 31.6 %
